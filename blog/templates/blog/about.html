        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blog is made using the programming language of Python and 
        using a framework of python called Django. It is using bootstrap as a library for html
        and css. In order to store the server in the internet, this blog will be using AWS S3 
        bucket to store the files required for the server to run. It uses Heroku for deploying 
        the server online so that it is accessible to the people of the class.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blog has a lot of useful features. This include being able
        to create, delete, update a post. There is also functionality to like and comment on a
        post. But in order to do any of that, you need to be logged in and this is to make sure
        that not anyone can have access to the blog if they wanted. When logged in a profile is 
        created and a profile picture can be set for that user. There is also a rich text editor
        for formatting text and images can be added to posts as well. Last but not least, there
        is also functionality for a search bar and also pagination so that all the posts are not
        loaded in the same page.
